      <h1>Which loan type is best for me</h1>
      <p class="panel" style="margin-top:12px">
        The right mortgage depends on your score, down payment, location, and status. This guide compares the big four programs and when each tends to shine.
      </p>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>Fast comparison</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Conventional</strong> Best for solid credit and at least three percent down. Lower monthly mortgage insurance as scores rise. Great for second homes and most condos.</li>
          <li><strong>FHA</strong> Helpful with modest scores or higher debt ratios. Three point five percent down is common. Upfront and monthly insurance applies.</li>
          <li><strong>VA</strong> For eligible service members and veterans. Often no down payment and no monthly mortgage insurance. Funding fee may apply.</li>
          <li><strong>USDA</strong> For eligible rural areas and income ranges. Often no down payment. Property location and household income limits apply.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>Minimum scores and down payments</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Conventional</strong> Many lenders want six hundred twenty or higher. Down payment from three percent.</li>
          <li><strong>FHA</strong> Often works from five eighty with three point five percent down. Lower scores can require more down.</li>
          <li><strong>VA</strong> No official minimum score in the rule book. Many lenders look for six hundred to six twenty. Down payment is often zero.</li>
          <li><strong>USDA</strong> Automated approvals often like six hundred forty. Zero down if you qualify by area and income.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:10px">Guidelines vary by lender and market. A strong local lender matters.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>What the monthly payment looks like</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Conventional</strong> Mortgage insurance can be removed later when equity grows. Pricing improves with higher scores.</li>
          <li><strong>FHA</strong> Monthly insurance is usually required for at least eleven years, sometimes for the life of the loan, depending on down payment.</li>
          <li><strong>VA</strong> No monthly mortgage insurance. A one time funding fee may apply unless exempt.</li>
          <li><strong>USDA</strong> Has a modest upfront and monthly guarantee fee that stays for the loan term.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>Who each loan helps most</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Conventional</strong> Buyers with higher scores, larger down payment, or planning to remove mortgage insurance later.</li>
          <li><strong>FHA</strong> Buyers rebuilding credit or needing more flexible debt ratios.</li>
          <li><strong>VA</strong> Eligible borrowers who want low monthly cost and strong protections.</li>
          <li><strong>USDA</strong> Buyers in qualifying areas who meet income rules and want zero down.</li>
        </ul>
