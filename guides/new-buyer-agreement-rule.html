      <h1>The new buyer agreement rule explained</h1>
      <p class="panel" style="margin-top:12px">
        As of 2024 most buyers sign a short written agreement with their agent before touring homes. This guide explains what changed why it matters and how the agent fee is handled today.
      </p>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>What changed and why</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Written agreement first</strong> Before showings your agent needs a signed buyer broker agreement that sets services term and compensation.</li>
          <li><strong>No commission offers on MLS</strong> Listing systems removed public offers of compensation to buyer agents. Payment is now negotiated in the offer or paid directly by the buyer per the agreement.</li>
          <li><strong>Clarity for consumers</strong> You see in writing how your agent is paid and what they will do for you.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>What you will sign</h2>
        <p>The agreement can be exclusive for your whole search or limited for a single day or a single property. It usually covers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How long the agreement lasts and where it applies</li>
          <li>What services the agent provides showings research offer strategy negotiation and coordination through closing</li>
          <li>How the agent is paid and who is expected to pay</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>Who pays the buyer agent now</h2>
        <p>The fee is negotiable and disclosed in your agreement. Common options include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Seller paid</strong> Your offer requests a credit for buyer broker compensation that is paid at closing.</li>
          <li><strong>Buyer paid</strong> You agree to pay all or a portion at closing. Some buyers do this to strengthen an offer.</li>
          <li><strong>Mixed</strong> A seller credit covers part and you cover any shortfall.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In all cases you will see the numbers before you tour homes so there are no surprises later.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>Pros of signing early</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear expectations on service and cost</li>
          <li>Faster access to tours and offer prep</li>
          <li>Less confusion about who your agent represents</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>Tips before you sign</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ask for a short preview term</strong> A one day or one property agreement lets you try the fit before going exclusive.</li>
          <li><strong>Confirm the payment plan</strong> Make sure the agreement explains what happens if the seller does not pay a credit.</li>
          <li><strong>Compare service</strong> If two agents quote the same fee choose the one with the better plan for search pricing and negotiation.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
