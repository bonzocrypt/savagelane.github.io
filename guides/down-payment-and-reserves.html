        You do not always need twenty percent down. Learn typical minimums by loan type, what reserves are, and smart ways to structure your funds with gifts and assistance.
      </p>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>Typical minimums by loan type</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Conventional</strong> As low as three percent down for some first time buyers. Five percent is common.</li>
          <li><strong>FHA</strong> Three point five percent down with flexible credit rules.</li>
          <li><strong>VA</strong> Often zero down for eligible service members and veterans.</li>
          <li><strong>USDA</strong> Often zero down in eligible areas with income limits.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:10px">Minimums vary by lender and your profile. Ask a local lender to confirm your exact options.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>What reserves are and why they matter</h2>
        <p>Reserves are funds left over after closing. Lenders measure them in months of the total payment. One to three months is common for stronger files. More complex files can require more.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>Gift funds and assistance</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gifts</strong> Allowed on many loans with a signed gift letter and paper trail.</li>
          <li><strong>Down payment assistance</strong> Grants or second loans may help with cash to close. Some programs add income or location rules.</li>
          <li><strong>Seller credits</strong> Can reduce closing costs within program limits.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>How much should I actually bring</h2>
        <p>Plan for the down payment plus closing costs and a small cushion. See <a href="/guides/hidden-costs-buyers-should-expect.html">hidden costs buyers should expect</a> to build a full picture.</p>
