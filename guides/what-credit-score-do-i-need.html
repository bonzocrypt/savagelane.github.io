      <h1>What credit score do I need</h1>
      <p class="panel" style="margin-top:12px">
        You do not need perfect credit to buy a home. Lenders look at your middle mortgage score and a few other signals to choose loan options and pricing. Here is what score ranges usually unlock and how to lift your number before you shop.
      </p>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>Quick answer by loan type</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Conventional</strong> Many lenders want six hundred twenty or higher for approval with better pricing at six eighty, seven hundred, seven forty, and above.</li>
          <li><strong>FHA</strong> Often works at five eighty with three point five percent down. Lower scores may be possible with more down and clean recent history.</li>
          <li><strong>VA</strong> No official minimum in the rule book. Many lenders use six hundred to six twenty as a guide. Strong residual income helps.</li>
          <li><strong>USDA</strong> Six forty is a common benchmark for automated approvals. Below that can work with manual review when the file is strong.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:10px">These are typical guides, not promises. Lender overlays vary by company and market.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>What lenders actually check</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Middle mortgage score</strong> With three scores they use the middle. With two they use the lower. With one they use that one.</li>
          <li><strong>On time history</strong> Recent late payments hurt more than old ones.</li>
          <li><strong>Credit use</strong> High card balances compared to limits pull scores down even with perfect payment history.</li>
          <li><strong>Mix and age</strong> A longer clean history and a mix of accounts helps.</li>
          <li><strong>Collections and disputes</strong> Some items must be resolved before closing.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>Fast ways to lift your score</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Pay card balances down</strong> Aim for thirty percent or less of each limit. Ten percent is even better.</li>
          <li><strong>Prevent new late payments</strong> Turn on autopay for minimums so nothing slips.</li>
          <li><strong>Pause new accounts</strong> Several new lines can lower your average age and add inquiries.</li>
          <li><strong>Trim harmful authorized user cards</strong> Remove cards that show high balances or late history.</li>
          <li><strong>Fix clear report errors</strong> Duplicate collections and obvious mistakes can be corrected.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-top:10px">Close to a pricing tier A small bump can lower your rate and payment. See <a href="/guides/which-loan-type-is-best.html">which loan type is best for me</a> next.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>Score tiers and why pricing changes</h2>
        <p>On conventional loans, pricing improves as you move through tiers like six eighty, seven hundred, seven forty, and higher. FHA and VA are more forgiving on score but add their own costs and rules. A strong local lender can show how a few more points may lower your monthly payment.</p>

        <h2>Common questions</h2>
        <details>
          <summary>Can I buy with a score under six hundred</summary>
          <p>Sometimes yes, mainly with FHA and with more down, clean recent history, and a lender that allows it.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Do joint borrowers use an average score</summary>
          <p>No. Lenders use the lower middle score of the borrowers on the loan.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Do I need to pay off all collections</summary>
          <p>Not always. Medical collections and small items can be treated differently by loan type.</p>
