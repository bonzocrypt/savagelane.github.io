      <h1>How to review offers</h1>
      <p class="panel" style="margin-top:12px">
        When offers show up, it is tempting to focus on the top number. Strong sellers look at the whole picture price, financing strength, contingencies, and timing so they pick the offer most likely to reach the closing table with the least stress.
      </p>

      <section class="checklist">
        <h2 style="margin-top:0">Start with your goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Do you care most about final net, a smoother process, or exact timing</li>
          <li>Are you buying another home and need certainty on closing dates</li>
          <li>Would a rent back or flexible move out help you more than a small bump in price</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>Look beyond the top line price</h2>
        <p>
          The offer amount is important, but what matters is what you actually keep after credits and costs. Two offers with the same price can lead to very different results.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Price versus credits</strong> A higher price with big closing credits can reduce your net.</li>
          <li><strong>Concessions</strong> Seller paid home warranties, repair credits, and closing costs all change the bottom line.</li>
          <li><strong>Estimated net sheet</strong> Ask your agent to prepare a net sheet for each serious offer so you can compare in one glance.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>Check financing strength</h2>
        <p>
          The type of financing and the buyer profile tell you how likely the loan is to close cleanly and on time.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cash</strong> No loan approval, appraisal, or rate surprises but you still confirm proof of funds.</li>
          <li><strong>Conventional loan</strong> Often viewed as strong especially with a larger down payment and solid credit.</li>
          <li><strong>FHA, VA, or other programs</strong> Great for buyers, but may have stricter appraisal or property condition standards.</li>
          <li><strong>Pre approval quality</strong> Look for a current letter that names your property, from a lender who has verified income, assets, and credit.</li>
          <li><strong>Local versus distant lender</strong> Local lenders often understand your taxes, insurance, and timelines better, which can help avoid delays.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>Contingencies and risk</h2>
        <p>
          Contingencies give buyers a way out or a chance to renegotiate. Fewer, shorter, and clearer contingencies usually mean lower risk for you.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Inspection contingency</strong> Standard and healthy, but shorter periods and clear limits on repairs reduce surprises.</li>
          <li><strong>Appraisal contingency</strong> Protects the buyer if the value comes in low. A partial waiver or gap coverage can give you more confidence.</li>
          <li><strong>Financing contingency</strong> Needed for most loans, but you want clear deadlines and evidence that the buyer has already cleared early checks with the lender.</li>
          <li><strong>Home sale contingency</strong> Adds more moving parts. You and your agent should look at whether the buyer home is already listed, under contract, or still preparing.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="checklist">
        <h2 style="margin-top:0">Timeline and possession</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Closing date</strong> Does it align with your move out, school schedule, or purchase of another home</li>
          <li><strong>Possession after closing</strong> A rent back or few extra days to move can reduce stress if the buyer is flexible.</li>
          <li><strong>Lease back terms</strong> If you stay after closing, make sure rent, utilities, and responsibility for repairs are clear.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>Comparing multiple offers</h2>
        <p>
          When you have several offers, a simple side by side table helps you see the real differences fast.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>List each buyer and price in separate columns.</li>
          <li>Add rows for net after credits, financing type, down payment, contingencies, and closing date.</li>
          <li>Mark risk items like home sale contingency or long inspection periods.</li>
          <li>Talk through which offer gives you the best balance of price, certainty, and timing.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section class="accent">
        <h3>Tip</h3>
        <p>
          A slightly lower price from a strong, well qualified buyer with clean terms often beats a higher offer with weak financing, extra contingencies, and a complicated timeline.
        </p>
