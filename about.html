      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I’m a licensed real estate professional with nearly two decades of experience in finance and over seven years proudly affiliated with <strong>Coldwell Banker Realty</strong>. During that time, I had the opportunity to work alongside some of the most knowledgeable and ethical agents in the business, all while helping countless individuals and families navigate one of the biggest financial and emotional milestones of their lives — buying or selling a home.
      </p>

      <p>
        My years with Coldwell Banker provided me with exceptional training and real-world experience. I was able to learn directly from seasoned Realtors who set the gold standard for professionalism, integrity, and client care. That environment not only sharpened my skills in real estate but reinforced something even more important — the human side of the business. Every move, every sale, every conversation represents someone’s next chapter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, I realized that many people enter the process unsure of what to expect. There are countless moving parts — financing, inspections, appraisals, contingencies — and often very little clear guidance. That realization inspired me to create <strong>Savage Lane</strong> as a way to share what I’ve learned and simplify the experience for others. Whether you’re just starting to explore homeownership or preparing to sell, my goal is to help you feel informed, confident, and supported from start to finish.
      </p>

      <p>
        I still receive regular calls from past clients, friends, and family members asking for advice, and I’m always happy to help point them in the right direction. This site is an extension of that same spirit — offering trustworthy education and connecting you with experienced, licensed Realtors through the <a href="/concierge.html">Home Match Concierge</a> program when you’re ready for the next step.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        <em>Note:</em> Savage Lane is an educational real estate resource. All brokerage services and client representation are provided exclusively through licensed Realtors affiliated with Coldwell Banker Realty Referral Network (CBRRN) and their partner agents.
