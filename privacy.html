      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>Savage Lane operates a referral concierge for real estate. We act in a referral only capacity. After you submit our form we register your request with our brokerage referral program so a licensed sales professional can contact you about your real estate needs. We do not list, show, or negotiate real estate.</p>

      <h2>What we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Contact details such as name, email, phone</li>
        <li>Location such as ZIP or city and state</li>
        <li>Basic intent such as buying, selling, or both plus optional timeline and notes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How we collect it</h2>
      <p>Information is collected when you submit the form on <strong>savagelane.com</strong>. Form handling is provided by Formspree which securely relays submissions to our email and dashboard.</p>

      <h2>How we use information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To review your request and confirm we received it</li>
        <li>To register your request with our brokerage referral program for placement with a qualified licensed sales professional</li>
        <li>To stay in touch about status and service quality</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sharing</h2>
      <p>We share your details only as needed to register and place your referral with the brokerage referral program and the assigned licensed sales professional. We do not sell personal information.</p>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>We keep referral records for as long as needed for placement, follow up, and compliance. If you ask us to delete your information we will do so unless we must keep it for legal or record keeping reasons.</p>

      <h2>Your choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You may request access, correction, or deletion of your information</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We use reasonable administrative and technical safeguards. No method of transmission or storage is perfectly secure, but we work to protect your information.</p>
